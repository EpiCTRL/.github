# EpiCTRL
Welcome to the EpiCTRL GitHub page! We are a passionate team dedicated to developing innovative solutions for individuals and families living with epilepsy. Our mission is to improve quality of life, enhance safety, and foster a supportive community through technology.

## About Us
EpiCTRL was founded with a personal connection to epilepsy, driving us to seek real, impactful changes in how epilepsy is managed daily. With a focus on wearable technology, EpiCTRL utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to provide accurate, real-time monitoring and alert systems for tonic-clonic seizures.

### Our Vision
To revolutionize the management of epilepsy, providing peace of mind and freedom to those affected and their families.

### Our Product
The EpiCTRL Guardian, our flagship product, is a smartwatch app that monitors vital parameters to detect epileptic seizures. It informs caregivers about the occurrence and location of a seizure and provides bystanders with instructions for appropriate first aid, mimicking the functionality of a heart defibrillator in emergency situations.
